# Use-cases Affected by Privacy Changes on the Web
<sup>[Home][home] > Use Cases</sup>

This directory explores known use-cases affected by current or future privacy
changes on the web. As of November 2021 these use-cases are focused on
third-party cookies as the most urgent changing primitive on the web. However
[as noted by the FedCM project][fedcm-navigational-tracking], we should keep the
longer-term *direction* of browser privacy changes in mind and how that might
affect payments.

## Use-cases

* [Payment Buttons](payment-buttons.md)
* [Secure Payment Confirmation enrollment status](spc.md)
* [Anti-Fraud measures](anti-fraud.md)
