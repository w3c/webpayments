      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This specification is a <a href="#dfn-payment-transaction-message-specification">Payment Transaction Message Specification</a> used by the PaymentRequest API
        [[!PAYMENTREQUESTAPI]] to support payment by tokenized payment cards.</p>

      <p>Tokenization provides some advantages over traditional card payments - tokenized credentials are often narrowly scoped, for example single-use or merchant/amount/time scoped.  Tokenized credentials also help alleviate some concerns about merchant data breaches since the merchant does not have the raw PAN.  This provides some additional security for a consumer.

    <section id="method-id">
      <h2>Payment Method Identifier</h2>
      <p>The <a>payment method identifier</a> string for the Tokenized Card Payment method is <dfn><code>card-token</code></dfn>.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="request">
      <h2>Payment Method Specific Data for the PaymentRequest constructor</h2>
      <p>This section describes payment method specific data that is supplied as part of the <code>data</code>
      argument to the <a>PaymentRequest constructor</a>.</p>

      <section>
      <h3>TokenCardRequest</h3>
      <pre class="idl">
        enum TokenCardType { "emv", "issuer" };

        dictionary TokenCardRequest {
          sequence&lt;DOMString&gt; supportedNetworks;
          sequence&lt;TokenCardType&gt; supportedTypes;
        };
      </pre>

      <p>
        The <code>TokenCardRequest</code> dictionary contains the following fields:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn><code>supportedNetworks</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>supportedNetworks</code> field contains a sequence of identifiers for card networks
        that the merchant accepts. See <a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/card-network-ids">Card Network Identifiers Approved for use with Payment Request API</a> for approved values.</dd>
        <dt><dfn><code>supportedTypes</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>supportedTypes</code> field contains a sequence of token card types that the merchant
        accepts. The values mean the following:
	  <ul>
	    <li>"emv": These are tokens (typically single-use) provided by card networks (cf. <code>supportedNetworks</code>) that represent the underlying PAN.</li>
	    <li>"issuer": With these tokens, a provider serves as a card issuer by generating a new card number.  This new card number is backed by the original PAN or by another funding source.  During charging of these tokens, the provider translates the generated card number back into the original PAN or original funding source.</li>
	  </ul>
      </dl>

      <p>The <code>supportedNetworks</code> and <code>supportedTypes</code> fields are both optional.
        If neither is provided then any card may be returned. If only <code>supportedNetworks</code>
        is provided then any card type may be returned provided it matches one of the networks.
        If only <code>supportedTypes</code> is provided then a card may be returned from any network
        provided it matches one of the types.</p>

      <p>Implementations will determine how to match values of <code>supportedTypes</code>.</p>

      <p class="note">
        This specification covers a limited number of <code>supportedTokens</code>. Although there are other types of tokens such as gateway tokens, because they involve substantially different flows of information (e.g., merchant onboarding), this specification does not cover them.</p>

    </section>

    <section id="response">
      <h2>Payment Method Response</h2>
      <p>
        The <dfn id="dom-tokenizedcardresponse"><code>TokenizedCardResponse</code></dfn> dictionary contains the response from the PaymentRequest API when a user accepts payment with a Tokenized Payment Card payment method.  The intention is for this to extend from the BasicCardResponse (defined in [[!BASICCARD]]) with some additional fields required for tokenization.  It should be noted that the "cardSecurityCode" from the BasicCardResponse will contain a card security code for issuer-based tokens, but will contain the cryptogram for network tokens.  The combination of cardNumber (the token number) + cardSecurityCode (either cryptogram or security code) establishes a one-time use credential.
      </p>

      <pre class="idl">
        dictionary TokenizedCardResponse: BasicCardResponse {
            required DOMString          cardLast4;
            DOMString          tokenType;
            DOMString        tokenRequesterId;
        };
      </pre>

      <p>
        The <code>TokenizedCardResponse</code> dictionary contains the following fields:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn><code>cardLast4</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>cardLast4</code> field contains the last 4 digits of the original (non-token) primary account number (PAN) for the payment card.  This may be used for display purposes during the purchase.</dd>
        <dt><dfn><code>tokenType</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>tokenType</code> field contains the token type selected by the user. This is one of the values of <code>supportedTypes</code>.</dd>
        <dt><dfn><code>tokenRequesterId</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>tokenRequesterId</code> field contains ID of the entity that requested the token from the network (likely the creator of the payment app).  This field is only applicable when <code>tokenType</code> is "emv".</dd>
      </dl>
