<section id='abstract'>
  <p>The Payment Request API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] provides
    a standard way to initiate payment requests from Web pages and
    applications. User agents implementing that API prompt the user
    to select a way to handle the payment request, after which
    the user agent returns a payment response to the originating site.
    This specification adds <strong>payment apps</strong>
    to that user experience. It defines how users
    register payment apps with user agents, how user agents support the display of
    information about payment options the user can select to handle the
    payment request, how the user selects a payment app, and how communication takes
    place between user agents and payment apps to fulfill the requirements of the
    underlying Payment Request API.</p>

<section class='informative'>
  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p>The Web Payments Working Group seeks to streamline payments on the Web to
  help reduce payment "abandonment" and make it easier to use
  new payment methods on the Web. It has published the Payment Request
  API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] as a standard way to initiate payment
  requests from Web pages and applications. This specification adds
    payment apps to that user experience. A payment app is software that
    enables the user to fulfill a payment request using the user's
    preferred payment method.</p>

    <p>This specification defines:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How users register and unregister payment apps with the user agent.</li>
      <li>How the user agent matches payment methods supported by the payee with those enabled in registered payment apps.</li>
      <li>How the user agent displays information about payment options to the user for selection.</li>
      <li>How the user agent invokes a payment app, communicates input/response data with it, and returns the response data to the underlying Payment Request API.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>Payment apps may be implemented in a variety of ways: as Web applications, native operating system applications,
      browser extensions, built-in user agent components, interface-less Web services, or a combination.
      This specification does not cover every aspect of communication on every platform.</p>
  <p class="note" title="User agent as payment request mediator">The Web Payments Working Group has used the term
      "mediator" to refer to the software (here, the user agent) that carries out the activities defined in this
      specification (matching, information display, etc.).</p>
</section>
<section id='conformance'>
    <p>
        This specification defines one class of products:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt><dfn>Conforming user agent</dfn></dt>
        <dd>
            <p>
                A <a>user agent</a> MUST behave as described in this specification
                in order to be considered conformant. In this specification, <a>user agent</a> means a <em>Web
                browser or other interactive user agent</em> as defined in [[!HTML5]].
            </p>
            <p>
                User agents MAY implement algorithms given in this
                specification in any way desired, so long as the end result is
                indistinguishable from the result that would be obtained by the
                specification's algorithms.
            </p>
            <p>
                A conforming Payment App API user agent MUST also be a
                <em>conforming implementation</em> of the IDL fragments
                of this specification, as described in the
                “Web IDL” specification. [[!WEBIDL]]
            </p>

            <aside class="note">
                This specification uses both the terms "conforming user agent(s)"
                and "user agent(s)" to refer to this product class.

  <h2>Payment App Model and Design Considerations</h2>
  <p>This section (which may be temporary) intends to help build shared understanding of the capabilities and limitations of the specified model.</p>
  <section>
    <h3>General Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>This specification builds on PaymentRequest API.</li>
      <li>It defines mechanisms that may be used to support both Web-based and <a>native payment apps</a>. However, we anticipate
          that the ecosystem will also include proprietary approaches to some of the functionality defined here
          (e.g., for payment app registration or invocation).</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Registration and Unregistration</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>The user registers a payment app with the user agent, which provides developers with primitives for this
          purpose. For example, when using a Web-based payment app, the user can push a button to register the payment app.
          When using a native app, the native app can open a Web page that supports registration.</li>
      <li>During registration, information about enabled payment methods and available payment options is provided to the user agent. 
          The user agent stores this information for subsequent actions (e.g., when matching merchant-accepted payment methods). In this
          proposal, there are no requirements for a payment app to be able to respond to user agent queries for updated
          registration information. We expect payment apps to update the information that a user agent has stored about them
          by re-calling the registration API.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Payment App Matching</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>When the user invokes the Payment Request API (by, for example, "pushing the Buy button"), the user agent
          computes the intersection between merchant-accepted payment methods and user-registered payment methods. It
          does this by comparing Payment Request API data (from the payee) and data provided during registration, 
          invoking the comparison algorithm defined in the Payment Method Identifier specification. The result is a list of
          matching payment options and recommended payment apps.</li>
      <li>Using information provided during registration (e.g., an app name or icon),the user agent displays matching
          payment options for selection by the user. The user agent may also display merchant-specified or user agent-specified recommended payment apps, which are
          displayed distinctly for the user. This mechanism is intended to support use cases such as a merchant
          recommending their own payment app to the user, or the user agent helping the user find payment apps that are
        relevant for a transaction but that the user has not yet registered or enabled.
	<p class="note" title="Browser selection features not in scope">The user agent may offer features to facilitate selection (e.g., launch a chosen payment app or option every time the
          user wants to pay at a given Web site); those features lie outside the scope of this specification.</p></li>
      <li>The user selects a payment option to make a payment. If the user selected a recommended payment app, behavior
          depends on whether the payment app is unregistered or registered.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Payment App Invocation and Response</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Based on information provided at registration, the user agent "launches" the payment app and provides it with
          input data drawn from the Payment Request API.</li>
      <li>This specification defines an HTTP-based mechanism for providing input data to the payment app. In some
          systems, payment apps may bypass this mechanism entirely, but that behavior lies outside the scope of this
          specification.</li>
      <li>The user may interact with the payment app in a variety of ways to authorize payment, cancel the transaction,
          or carry out other activities supported by the payment app. This specification does not address payment app
          behavior other than accepting requests and returning responses to the user agent.</li>
      <li>This specification defines a means for the user agent to receive a response asynchronously once the user has
          authorized payment. The response becomes the response of the Payment Request API.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Network Considerations</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>This specification only describes communication between the user agent and the payment app. This includes an
          asynchronous mechanism for a payment app to return a payment response to the user agent. This specification
          does not address scenarios where the user agent does not receive the response (e.g., due to a crash our
          network outage).</li>
      <li>This specification does not address communication between the payee server and the payee Web app, or between
          the payment app and other parties (e.g., the payment app distibutor, or directly to the merchant).</li>
    </ul>

          A remote payment app may be getting payment authorization from the user via different channel (such as a

          If the user cancels the handling of the payment request then the app should return a response
          with an appropriate error/response code. Will this be done through the HTTP status code or defined as a value
          that is set in the response.

            <li>An alternative is to ensure that the payment app and the user agent have a channel so that communication continues until all aprties are satisfied they share the same view of the payment response. This might involve caching payment responses.</li>

    <h3>Payment App Display</h3>
    <p class="issue" title="Payment app instantiation" data-number="143">
        The Working Group is still discussing how payment apps are displayed for user interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Payment apps are invoked via an HTTP request. If the resulting HTTP response body is text/html then the user agent
        MUST render this content for the user.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The user agent MUST render the <a>Response</a> in a new secure context.</li>
      <li>The user agent MUST make the <code>PaymentApp.respond()</code> method available to the page that is
        rendered.</li>
    </ol>
        <p>
        This specification does not otherwise prescribe how user agents render the payment app. This may be in a new tab/window, in
        a special modal dialogue specifically for this purpose, in an iframe embedded in the web page of the payee
        website or any other mechanism the user agent defines.
    </p>
    <section>
        <h4>The PaymentAppResponse dictionary</h4>
        <p>
            A payment app that runs in the user agent responds to a payment request by returning a new
            <code>PaymentAppResponse</code> via the <code>PaymentApp.respond()</code> method.
        </p>
<pre class="idl">
dictionary PaymentAppResponse {
    DOMString method;
    object details;
};
</pre>
        <dl>
            <dt><code>method</code> member</dt>
            <dd>
                The <dfn id="payment-app-response-method"><code>method</code> member</dfn> is the payment method
                identifer of the payment method used to handle the payment request.
            </dd>
            <dt><code>details</code> member</dt>
            <dd>
                The <dfn id="payment-app-response-details"><code>details</code></dfn> member contains the payment method
                specific data that is expected in a payment response.
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h4>PaymentApp.respond()</h4>
      <p>
        The payment app submits the <code>PaymentAppResponse</code> by calling the <code>respond()</code> method and
          passing this in as a parameter.
      </p>
<pre class="idl">
partial interface PaymentApp {
    static void respond (PaymentAppResponse response);
};
</pre>
      <p>The <a><code>respond</code></a> method MUST act as follows:</p>
      <p class="issue" title="Define algorithm for passing response back to calling context">
        This should be a light algorithm that simply hands off to the steps defined in Payment Request
      </p>
      <p>The following example shows how to respond to a payment request:</p>
      <pre class="example highlight">
             PaymentApp.respond(
               "https://webpayments.org/payment-methods/card/visa",
               {
                 card_number :  "1232343451234",
                 expiry_month : "12",
                 expiry_year :  "2020",
                 cvv :          "123"
               });
      </pre>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h3>Payment App Response</h3>
    <p>
      The user agent receives a response from the payment app in one of two forms:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>a JSON serialized
        <code>PaymentAppResponse</code> sent as a response to the HTTP request that invoked the app</li>
      <li>a
        <code>PaymentAppResponse</code> dictionary instance submitted via the <code>PaymentApp.respond()</code> method</li>
    </ol>
      <p>
          The user agent MUST use this <code>PaymentAppResponse</code> to resolve the promise that was created
          by <a>PaymentRequest.show</a> when the user agent executed the <a>user accepts the payment request algorithm</a>
          as defined in [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]].
      </p>
     <p class="issue" title="Generic callback back-channel for the payment response transmission">
       Some payment methods might require a back channel to guarantee payment response delivery (especially push payment methods).
       Should it be part of the generic portion of paymentRequest and paymentResponse?
