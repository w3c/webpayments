    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="issue" title=
            "Should this document be combined with the Payment Request API specification?">
        <p>
            The majority of the following text gives context to this specification in relation
            to the Payment Request API specification. It repeats a lot of information that is
            already captured in other specifications suggesting the two should be combined.
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, since the requirements for registration and interoperability of payment apps with user agents
            is currently described in this document and the processing of payment requests by the API is
            described in another document neither document can exist in isolation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Therefor it may make sense to either:
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the two documents</li>
            <li>Establish some normative relationship between them</li>
        </ol>
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>The Payment Request API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] defines an API
        for websites to initiate payment requests in a <a>user
            agent</a>. These payment requests are then passed to a
        <a>payment app</a> for processing.</p>
    <p>The <a>payment app</a> is an application that is registered by
        the payer with the <a>user agent</a>. <a>Payment apps</a> support
        one or more <a>payment methods</a> for processing payment requests.</p>
    <p>The Payment Request API specification
        describes how the <a>user agent</a>, acting as a mediator between
        the payee website and the payer, assists the user in selecting a
        <a>payment app</a> that can process the payment request it has received
        from the website. This implies that the selected <a>payment app</a>
        will support at least one of the <a>payment methods</a> that is also
        supported by the payee.</p>
    <p>This specification describes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>How payment app publishers register <a>payment apps</a> with
            the <a>user agent</a>.</li>
        <li>How, after the user selects a payment app to use, the payment
            request is passed to the <a>payment app</a>.</li>
        <li>How a payment response is then returned by the app to the
            <a>user agent</a>?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The API described in this document forms part of the payment
        request processing system described in the Architecture for Processing
        Payment Requests [[!PAYMENT-ARCH]].</p>
    <section id="goals">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Allow users to register <a>payment apps</a> with their user
                agent such that the user agent is able to maintain a registry of
                the <a>payment methods</a> that are enabled by the app.</li>
            <li>Allow <a>payment apps</a> to update the set of <a>payment
                methods</a> that they have enabled.</li>
            <li>Standardize a platform-independant mechanism for a <a>user
                agent</a> to pass a payment request to a <a>payment app</a>.</li>
            <li>Support <a>payment apps</a>, with or without a user interface,
                on any web-accessible platform.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="non-goals">
        <h2>Non-goals</h2>
        <p>This specification does not attempt to define the full set of
            interfaces between the <a>user agent</a> and <a>payment apps</a>
            as it is anticipated that <a>payment apps</a>
            will be implemented on a variety of platforms and that the
            interfaces between the <a>user agent</a> and apps on platforms
            other than the Web will be implementation specific.</p>

    <div class="issue" data-number="" title=
            "What are the appropriate conformance criteria for user agents and apps?">
        <p>This specification describes a mechanism that all user agents
            MUST support in order to allow for third party payment apps to be
            published and used from that user agent, however user agents may
            also have built in payment apps or allow other types of payment app
            such as browser extensions. How the integration works for these is
            implementation specific so we need to word the conformance criteria
            appropriately.</p>

                algorithms.</p>
            <p>A conforming user agent MUST also be a <em>conforming

    <h2>Payment apps</h2>
    <p><dfn data-lt="payment apps|payment app">Payment apps</dfn> are
        applications that process payment requests and return payment responses.
        They could take the form of sophisticated Web apps (using the full stack of
        Web technologies such as HTML5, CSS and JavaScript), simple <a>service workers</a>,
        interface-less Web services,  platform-specific native applications, built-in
        <a>user agent</a> components, browser extensions or even a combination of these.</p>
    <p>The <a>payment app</a> acts on behalf of the payer (or their
        chosen payment services provider) and performs any logic required
        for the chosen <a>payment method</a> to process the payment request.</p>
    <p>The specific processing required by the <a>payment app</a>,
        including the format of the payment request that the app accepts
        and the format of the reponse it returns, is defined by the
        <a>payment method specification</a> for the <a>payment
            method</a> that is used to process the transaction.</p>
    <section>
        <h3>Supported vs Enabled Payment Methods</h3>
        <p><a>Payment apps</a> support one or more <a>payment methods</a>.
            Support for a payment method implies that the app SHOULD be able to
            process a payment request that conforms to the rules defined in the
            <a>payment method specification</a> for that payment
            method and SHOULD be able to return an appropriate response.</p>
        <p>However, sometimes an app will be designed to support a specific
            payment method but the app will not have been configured with the
            appropriate <a>payment method data</a> (such as user credentials)
            to process payments using that payment method. In that case the
            <a>payment app</a> is said to <code>support</code> the payment
            method but that payment method is not <code>enabled</code>.</p>
        <p>For example, a <a>payment app</a> may be capable of processing a
            credit card payment by simply returning the card details in the

    <h2>Registering a payment app</h2>
    <p>In order to begin processing payment requests from the <a>user
        agent</a> a <a>payment app</a> must first be registered so that the
        <a>user agent</a> is aware of the set of <a>payment methods</a> the
        app has enabled and the URL of the app's HTTP API entry point.</p>
    <p class="note">The process of <a>payment app</a> registration is modeled on the
        process defined for installing an application via a
        manifest, as described in [[APPMANIFEST]]. In future payment
        apps may also be installed via web app manifests.</p>

    <h2>Processing Payment Requests</h2>
    <p>When a <a>user agent</a> has completed the <a>payment app</a>
        selection algorithm as defined in the Payment Request API
        [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] it must pass the payment request to
        the <a>payment app</a> to be processed.</p>
    <p>How the <a>user agent</a> does this, depends on the communication method
        selected for communicating between the <a>user agent</a> and the <a>
        payment app</a>.</p>
    <section>
        <h3>Selecting a communication method</h3>
        <p>The <a>user agent</a> may select any one communication method from the

            member and the communication methods supported by the <a>user agent</a>.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h3>Communicating via javascript</h3>
        <p>This communication method is suitable for Browser-based payment apps that
            display an HTML user interface. They communicate using the following
            javascript API:</p>

<pre class="idl">
                partial interface Navigator {

            </ol>

                <a>PaymentResponse</a> to the <a>user agent</a> that can be
                returned to the website that submitted the initial
                <a>PaymentRequest</a>. It does this by calling

    <section>
        <h3>Communicating over HTTP</h3>
        <p>This communication method is intended for payment apps that do not require
            a user interface, and communicate the payment requests and responses as JSON
            over HTTP.</p>
        <section>
            <h4>Converting the Payment Request into JSON</h4>
            <p>Before the <a>PaymentRequest</a> can be submitted to the
                <a>payment app</a> it must be converted into a JSON serialized
                string.</p>
            <p>The <dfn>steps to convert the <code>PaymentRequest</code> to
                JSON</dfn> are given by the following algorithm. The algorithm
                takes a <a>PaymentRequest</a> (<var>request</var>) as input and
                returns a string.</p>
            <div class="issue" data-number="" title=
                    "Need to define an algorithm for converting the PaymentRequest to JSON">
                <p>
                    The algortihm for this conversion will depend on the outcome of
                    discussions around the shape of the PaymentRequest API. This
                    algorithm may also sit in the core messages spec.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The fact that there are elements of this specification that can't be decided
                    until the Payment Request API is decided is another indication that the two
                    should be combined or have a normative dependancy.
