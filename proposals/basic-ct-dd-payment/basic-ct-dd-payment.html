	The Basic SEPA Payment specification describes the data formats used by the PaymentRequest API [[!PAYMENTREQUESTAPI]] to support payment by SEPA payments such as SEPA Credit Transfer (SCT), SEPA Direct Debit (SDD CORE) and SEPA direct Debit between corporates (SDD B2B)

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
	This specification is a Payment Transaction Message Specification used by the PaymentRequest API [[!PAYMENTREQUESTAPI]] to support payment by SEPA payments such as SEPA Credit Transfer and SEPA direct debit. It is intended to provide compatibility for merchants who currently request account details from customers to ease adoption of the PaymentRequest API.</p>
      <p>In the future, merchants should favor payment methods that provide a tokenized response rather than clear text credit card details.</p>
