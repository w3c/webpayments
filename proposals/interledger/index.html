        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        This specification defines the "interledger" payment method for use,
        for instance, with the <a data-cite="payment-request">Payment Request
        API</a>. With it, merchants can request a payment that follows the
        Interledger standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>Interledger Protocol</dfn> defines a number of standards that
        can be universally applied to all payments, irrespective of the network
        used to initiate or receive the payment. These include a universal
        addressing scheme for any destination account, a two-phase
        request/response orchestration for payment authorization, and a
        standard message "signature" scheme using simple SHA-256 hash digests.

      <section>
        <h2>
          Interledger Addresses
        </h2>
        <p>
          An <dfn>Interledger Address</dfn> is an address for any account on
          any payment network that can be the target of a payment. This
          includes traditional payment accounts like bank accounts (identified
          by an IBAN or account number), or card accounts (identified by a
          PAN), but also accounts on newer networks such as distributed ledgers
          and crypto-currency systems. It is defined in the
          [[!interledger-addresses]] specification.
        </p>
        <p>
          The scheme is a hierarchical addressing scheme where addresses are
          expressed as case-sensitive, ASCII strings containing one or more
          segments delimited by the period character. Their hierarchical nature
          makes them well-suited for routing payments while their large allowed
          size means that new addresses can be created per payment and
          reference data included in the suffix.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>
          Conditions, Fulfillments and Errors
        </h2>
        <p>
          The <dfn>Condition</dfn> is a 32-byte number that is the result of
          performing the one-way SHA-256 hash operation on the 32-byte
          <dfn>Fulfillment</dfn>. The <a>Condition</a> is provided by the payer
          in an Interledger payment. The <a>Fulfillment</a> is returned by the
          payee in an Interledger payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the case of a failed payment an error will be returned with an
          appropriate <dfn>Interledger Error Code</dfn> to indicate the cause
          of the failure.
        </p>
        <p>
          More details on the role of conditions and fulfillments and details
          of the different error codes can be found in the
          [[!interledger-protocol]] specification.

        data-link-for="Payment Pointer">
          Payment Pointer
        </h2>
        <p>
          A <dfn>Payment Pointer</dfn> is an identifer, that can be used to
          resolve and discover the details of a payment. It may resolve to the
          details of an entity or a specific obligation that can be paid (such
          as an invoice).
        </p>
        <p>
          Specifically, a <a>Payment Pointer</a> is resolved to a <dfn>payment
          setup protocol receiver endpoint</dfn> as defined in the
          [[!payment-pointers]] specification.

        <h2>
          Flow
        </h2>
        <p>
          An Interledger payment is initiated by the payer upon receipt of a
          <a>Payment Pointer</a> from the payee. The payer (or their agent)
          uses this to resolve a <a>payment setup protocol receiver
          endpoint</a> which it queries for the details of the payment.
        </p>
        <p>
          The payer then completes an Interledger payment and returns the
          <a>Interledger Address</a> and <a>Fulfillment</a> to the payee to
          allow them to verify the payment has been completed successfully.
