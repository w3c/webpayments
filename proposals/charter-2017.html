        Goals
      </h2>
      <p>
        Fragmentation of the payment landscape is limiting the full potential
        of the Web, including lack of standards in areas such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>the high level flow of a Web payment;
        </li>
        <li>the programming interfaces between the various parties (such as
        between user agent and Web application);
        </li>
        <li>the messages exchanged between these parties over the Web.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If successful, the Recommendations from this Working Group will
        increase some areas of interoperability between payer and payee
        systems, producing benefits such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A better checkout experience for users, particularly on mobile
        devices. The standards should facilitate automation, one approach to
        improving the user experience.
        </li>
        <li>Streamlined <a href="#payment_flow">payment flow</a>, which is
        expected to reduce the percentage of transactions abandoned prior to
        completion ("shopping cart abandonment").
        </li>
        <li>Easier adoption of payment instrument improvements (e.g., related
        to security) or new payment instruments.
        </li>
        <li>Added value through machine-readable digital payment requests and
        payment responses.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Under this charter, the Working Group defines Recommendations that
        allow for a payment to be initiated within a Web application.
      </p>
      <div class="scope">
        <h2 id="scope">
          Scope
        </h2>
        <p>
          The Working Group will Recommend:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>a set of messages that can be used to accomplish a payment,
          </li>
          <li>message flows for the initiation and, where scheme-permitting,
          confirmation or completion of a payment, and
          </li>
          <li>an API to allow Web applications to participate in these flows.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The Working Group will also Recommend how Web applications and
          digital payment instruments exchange these messages through a
          mediating user agent; see the <a href=
          "#deliverables">deliverables</a> section for further detail.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Working Group is chartered to Recommend programming interfaces;
          not user interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Working Group will not define a new <a href=

            A set of rules for the execution of payment transactions that are
            followed by adhering entities (payment processors, payers and
            payees), where transactions take place over networks (such as the
            Web). Some digital payment schemes make use internally of payment
            instruments from other payment schemes. How they register and
            communicate with internal payment instruments is beyond the scope
            of this charter.

            A logical container for digital payment instruments. A digital
            wallet affords access to digital payment instruments, providing
            registration and discovery of digital payment instruments. In this
            charter, a digital wallet is an entity that provides these
            functions by fulfilling the specified APIs for registration and
            discovery. The entity fulfilling the APIs may be a user agent, or a
            user agent may ultimately locate payment instruments via other more
            specialized digital wallets.

          Required Capabilities
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Working Group will specify the following capabilities, in order
          to support a payment from a payer to a payee, whether a credit push
          (payer initiated) or a debit pull (payee initiated):
        </p>
        <dl>

            Pre-Payment
          </dt>

              <li>
                <strong>Registration</strong> of the payer's <a href=
                "#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment instruments</a>.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </dd>

            Negotiation of Terms</a>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Payment Request</strong>, by the payee to the payer
                providing the terms of the payment including elements such as
                the accepted <a href="#digital-payment-scheme">digital payment
                schemes</a>, price, currency, recurrence, transaction type,
                timeout and requests for any additional data that is required
                from the payee.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </dd>
          <dt>
            <a href=
            "//www.w3.org/TR/web-payments-use-cases/#negotiation-of-payment-instruments">
            Negotiation of Payment Instruments</a>
          </dt>
          <dd>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Discovery</strong>, by the payer, of their available
                <a href="#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment
                instruments</a> that can be used to make the payment. This is
                done by matching those registered by the payer with those
                supported by the payee (as defined in the Payment Request),
                while keeping information local to the payer.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Payment Response</strong> from the digital payment
                instrument, which may vary according to digital payment scheme.
                For example, for a credit push instrument, the response may
                include a notification or proof of execution of the payment.
                For a debit pull instrument, the response may include the
                information necessary for the payee to execute the payment.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p>
          In addition to these capabilities, user agents and digital wallets
          are expected to fulfill a variety of roles (e.g., displaying a
          selection of payment instruments and enabling the user to select one)
          that will not be specified in the deliverables of this Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Working Group will consider support for deferred payment
          execution to enable use cases where the actual execution of a payment
          requires steps that are out-of-band with respect to the message flows
          and APIs defined by the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Working Group will also address exceptions that may occur during
          these steps, including payment authorization failure, lack of
          available <a href="#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment
          instruments</a>, and lack of suitable <a href=
          "#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment instruments</a>.
        </p>
        <h3 id="digital_wallets">
          Digital Wallets
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Working Group may define APIs that will also be used outside of a
          user agent context, such as between Web services, or from within a
          native application (where the proxy between the payer's digital
          payment instruments and the payee's application is not a browser).
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Working Group specifies interactions with a digital wallet,
          the Working Group will assure that users are able to use more than
          one digital wallet. The phrase "the payer's digital wallet" is
          shorthand for "the payer's digital wallet(s)."
        </p>
        <p>
          The Working Group may consider the use case where an aggregation
          service acts as a more sophisticated digital wallet or provides a
          wider choice of payment solutions to the payer. For example, the
          aggregator service might combine the functionality of multiple
          digital wallets, or apply more complex algorithms to discover and
          collect the set of <a href="#digital-payment-instrument">digital
          payment instruments</a> available to the payer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recommendations for loyalty schemes and coupons, digital receipts,
          digital credentials, tickets, and location services are out of scope.
          Future W3C activities may seek to increase interoperability of these
          or other additional digital wallet capabilities.
        </p>
        <h3 id="security">
          Security and Privacy Considerations
        </h3>
        <p>
          Security is obviously critical in payments.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key consideration is the ability to prove message integrity and
          authentication of all message originators. The Working Group will
          work with the organizations listed in the liaisons section of the
          charter to help ensure API security.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are other aspects of security (e.g., authentication of payer
          identity) that the Working Group will leave to individual <a href=
          "#digital-payment-scheme">digital payment schemes</a>. The Working
          Group will not define authentication mechanisms (e.g., hardware-based
          solutions in securing transactions, or authenticating users via
          biometry or other mechanisms) but should be aware of industry
          developments to help ensure compatibility with the flows defined by
          this group.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition, W3C might develop additional security-related
          specifications in other groups that may be adopted in <a href=
          "#digital-payment-scheme">digital payment schemes</a>. This group
          will follow any such work to help ensure compatibility with the
          payment flows described in this charter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Protection of the privacy of all participants in a payment is
          essential to maintaining the trust that payment systems are dependent
          upon to function. A payment process defined by this group should not
          disclose private details of the participants' identity or other
          sensitive information unless required for operational purposes, by
          legal or jurisdictional rules, or when deliberately consented to
          (e.g. as part of a loyalty program) by the owner of the information.
          The design of any API should guard against the unwanted leakage of
          such data through exploitation of the API.
        </p>
        <h3 id="regulatory">
          Relation to Regulatory Requirements
        </h3>
        <p>
          <a href="#digital-payment-scheme">Digital payment schemes</a> define
          how various parties meet relevant regulatory obligations. The
          deliverables of this group should not prevent parties from meeting
          those obligations.

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Digital Payment Scheme Description</strong>: used by payees

          <li>
            <strong>Payment Terms Description</strong>: used to define the
            terms requested by the payee in the payment request and the terms
            accepted by the payer in the payment response. It includes
            information such as amount, currency, payee account information,
            recurrence, transaction reference and any scheme-specific data that
            is required.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proof of Payment</strong>: scheme and instrument
            permitting, a payment authorization from the account provider to
            the payee. The proof must include information about the payment
            request (a transaction reference or similar) and the payer's
            <a href="#digital-payment-instrument">digital payment
            instrument</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>

          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Web Payment Request</strong>: The payee passes a payment

            any other required data to pass back to the payee.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Instrument Response</strong>: After a payer has selected
            their chosen payment instrument, the payment instrument sends data
            back to the payee (either indicating payment has completed, or with
            information to enable the payee to cause the payment to be
            completed).

            the payment messages may be proxied between a Web application and
            the payer's digital payment instruments via a JavaScript API hosted
            by a user agent.

            <strong>User agent to server-side wallet communication</strong>:
            Where request messages are passed to a server-side wallet, for
            example via HTTP, JavaScript, or some other approach.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>User agent to digital payment instrument
            communication</strong> : For the request and response messages for
            the digital payment instrument response, the payment messages are
            sent between a user agent and a registered digital payment
            instrument.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Inter-app on mobile devices (Optional)</strong>: If
            possible the group will Recommend a delivery mechanism for payment
            messages between apps on a mobile device so that digital wallet
            applications can seamlessly interface with Websites running inside
            a mobile device's user agent.

          Decision Policy

        <p>
          As explained in the Process Document (<a href=
          "/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section 3.3</a>), this group
          will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. When a Chair
          puts a question and observes dissent, after due consideration of
          different opinions, the Chair should put a question out for voting
          within the group (allowing for remote asynchronous participation --
          using, for example, email and/or web-based survey techniques) and
          record a decision, along with any objections. The matter should then
          be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes
          available.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any resolution first taken in a face-to-face meeting or
          teleconference (i.e., that does not follow a 7 day call for consensus
          on the mailing list) is to be considered provisional until 5 working
          days after the publication of the draft resolution. If no objections
          are raised on the mailing list within that time, the resolution will
          be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
