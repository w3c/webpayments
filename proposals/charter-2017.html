        [DRAFT] Web Payments Working Group Charter
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>This charter is in development.</em>
      </p>
      <p class="mission">
        The mission of the Web Payments Working Group is to make payments
        easier and more secure on the Web. The group seeks to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>streamline checkout through the reuse of stored information,
        simplifying the user experience to matching payment apps (both native
        and web), and creating consistency across Web sites, browsers, and
        operating systems. These improvements should help reduce the percentage
        of transactions abandoned prior to completion ("shopping cart
        abandonment") by improving consumer confidence in the payment
        experience;
        </li>
        <li>improve payment security by fostering digital payment method
        innovation on the Web;
        </li>
        <li>simplify and lower the cost of creating effective Web checkout
        experiences;
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Under this charter, the Working Group defines Recommendations that
        allow for a payment to be initiated within a Web application.

        <p>
          The Working Group will continue to advance these specifications to
          Recommendation:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-request/">Payment Request
            API</a>, which standardizes an API to allow merchants (i.e., Web
            sites selling physical or digital goods) to utilize one or more
            payment methods with minimal integration. User agents (e.g.,
            browsers) facilitate the payment flow between merchant and user,
            mediating the user experience and providing consistency between
            different merchants and providers.

          <li>
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-handler/">Payment Handler
            API</a>, which defines capabilities that enable Web applications to
            handle payment requests. The specification defines how payment apps
            register their capabilities with the user agent, how the user agent
            communicates with them, and what information is exchanged.

          <li>
            <a href="https://w3c.github.io/payment-method-manifest/">Payment
            Method Manifest</a>, which allows the curators of a defined payment
            method or owners of a proprietory payment method to authorize (via
            a manifest fiel) which payment apps may be used to fulfill the
            payment method. The scope of this work extends to all types of
            payment apps, including native mobile apps and Web apps.

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Working Group will continue to develop the following payment
          method specification, intended to become a Working Group Note:

        </ul>
        <h3>
          Formal Adoption of Work Under Development
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Working Group has discussed, but not yet taken up formally, the
          payment method specifications on the following topics. The Working
          Group will decide whether these should be published on the
          Recommendation Track or as Working Group Notes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Card Payment Tokenization and/or Encryption (e.g. by Network,
          Gateway or Acquirer)
          </li>
          <li>Credit Transfers (e.g. SEPA credit transfers)
          </li>
          <li>Direct Debits
          </li>
          <li>Interledger Payments (in cooperation with the <a href=
          "https://www.w3.org/community/interledger/">Interledger Payments
          Community Group</a>)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Working Group will account for exception handling in the design
          of payment method specifications. These include, but are not limited
          to, authorization failures and network failures.
        </p>
        <h3>
          New Topics
        </h3>
        <p>
          @@The Working Group will discuss new topics at TPAC 2017. These might
          include new (or postponed) features for version 2 of Payment Request
          API as well as new payment method specifications.@@
        </p>
        <h3>
          Curation of Working Group Resources
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Working Group will continue to curate the following resources it
          has published:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href=

            Identifiers Approved for use as filters with Payment Request
            API</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The Working Group may publish similar resources deemed important for
          the successful deployment of its other deliverables.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Discontinued Deliverables
        </h3>
        <p>
          The Working Group plans to discontinue work on the following
          specifications:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webpayments-http-api/">Web Payments
            HTTP API 1.0</a>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webpayments-http-messages/">HTTP
            Messages 1.0</a>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Note: W3C may choose to take up these specifications in a different
          Working Group chartered to develop APIs for out-of-browser payments
          such as Internet of Things payments. Comments or indications of
          support for these specifications are invited during both charter
          review and subsequently.
        </p>
        <h3>
          Out of Scope
        </h3>
        <p>
          The following topics are out of scope for this Working Group.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>This Working Group is chartered to Recommend programming
          interfaces, not user interfaces.
          </li>
          <li>The Working Group will not define authentication mechanisms
          (e.g., hardware-based solutions in securing transactions, or
          authenticating users via biometry or other mechanisms) but should be
          aware of industry developments to help ensure compatibility with the
          flows defined by this group. These include the deliverables of W3C's
          <a href="/Webauthn/">Web Authentication Working Group</a>.
          </li>
          <li>A digital payment scheme is a set of rules for the execution of
          payment transactions that are followed by adhering entities (payment
          service providers, processors, issuers, acquirers, payers and
          payees), where transactions take place over networks (such as the
          Web). A digital payment instrument is an account, token, or other
          means of fulfilling the payment provider's role in a digital payment
          scheme. Some digital payment schemes make use internally of payment
          instruments from other payment schemes. How they register and
          communicate with internal payment instruments is beyond the scope of
          this charter.
          </li>
          <li>Recommendations for loyalty schemes and coupons, digital
          receipts, digital credentials, tickets, and location services are out
          of scope.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="security">
          Security and Privacy Considerations
        </h3>
        <p>
          Security is obviously critical in payments.
        </p>
        <p>
          A key consideration is the ability to prove message integrity and
          authentication of all message originators. The Working Group will
          work with the organizations listed in the liaisons section of the
          charter to help ensure API security.
        </p>
        <p>
          Protection of the privacy of all participants in a payment is
          essential to maintaining the trust that payment systems are dependent
          upon to function. A payment process defined by this group should not
          disclose private details of the participants' identity or other
          sensitive information unless required for operational purposes, by
          legal or jurisdictional rules, or when deliberately consented to
          (e.g. as part of a loyalty program) by the owner of the information.
          The design of any API should guard against the unwanted or
          inadvertent leakage of such data through exploitation of the API.
        </p>
        <h3 id="regulatory">
          Relation to Regulatory Requirements
        </h3>
        <p>
          The deliverables of this group should enable parties involved in a
          payment transaction to meet any and all regulatory obligations.

        <p>
          The mission of the Web Commerce Interest Group (formerly the Web
          Payments Interest Group) is to improve Commerce on the Web for users,
          merchants, and other stakeholders. The Working Group expects to work
          with the Interest Group as follows:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Interest Group may review and comment on Working Group
          deliverables
          </li>
          <li>The Interest Group may play a role as "industry analyst,"
          understanding and communicating business and technology drivers that
          help to make the case for functionality enabled by the Working Group.
          As technology and industry requirements change, the Interest Group
          should update their analyses and keep the Working Group informed.

          To be successful, the Web Payments Working Group is expected to have
          10 active participants for its duration. Effective participation in
          Web Payments Working Group may consume .1 FTE for each participant;
          for editors this commitment may be higher.

          Communication

        <p>
          This group primarily conducts its work on the public mailing list
          public-payments-wg@w3.org (<a href=
          "https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-payments-wg/">archive</a>).
          Administrative tasks may be conducted in Member-only communications.

          Information about the group (deliverables, participants, face-to-face
          meetings, teleconferences, etc.) is available from the Web Payments
          Working Group home page.

          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          As explained in the Process Document (<a href=
          "/Consortium/Process/policies#Consensus">section 3.3</a>), this group
          will seek to make decisions when there is consensus. When a Chair
          puts a question and observes dissent, after due consideration of
          different opinions, the Chair should put a question out for voting
          within the group (allowing for remote asynchronous participation --
          using, for example, email and/or web-based survey techniques) and
          record a decision, along with any objections. The matter should then
          be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes
          available.
        </p>
        <p>
          Any resolution first taken in a face-to-face meeting or
          teleconference (i.e., that does not follow a 7 day call for consensus
          on the mailing list) is to be considered provisional until 5 working
          days after the publication of the draft resolution. If no objections
          are raised on the mailing list within that time, the resolution will
          be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Working Group.
