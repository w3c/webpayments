  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
This HTTP API enables a web application to initiate payment for a product or
service by responding with an HTTP 402 Payment Required response and
enough data to initiate and complete a payment flow. The
implementation of this feature is expected to be implemented by any HTTP
server and client that is interested in executing payments.

    <h2>How to Read this Document</h2>

    <p>This document is a detailed specification for a HyperText Transfer Protocol
      application programming interface (HTTP API) for executing payments via
      an HTTP client and server. The document is primarily intended for the following
      audiences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Software developers who want to understand the design decisions and
        algorithms behind the API.</li>

  <h2>Payment Flow Overview</h2>

  <p>
The diagram below outlines a basic HTTP client payment flow with no errors.
The basic flow starts out with the <a>payer</a> accessing a protected resource.
The <a>payee</a> provides a URL where a payment request for the resource
can be fetched. The <a>payer</a> fetches the payment request, selects
a payment app, and sends the request on to the appropriate
<a>payment service provider</a> for processing. The
<a>payment service provider</a> initiates the payment and sends a
payment response back to the <a>payer</a>. The <a>payer</a>
then forwards the payment response back to the
<a>payee</a>. If there are no errors, the <a>payee</a> then grants access to
the resource that was purchased.
  </p>

  <p class="issue">
The flow below reflects a fairly advanced tokenized payment scenario. We may
want to use a simpler basic credit card flow where the customer doesn't have
a payment service provider and just returns the credit card details to the
merchant.
  </p>

  <script type='text/jumly+sequence'>
@found "Payment Service Provider (customer)"
@found "Payer client (customer)", ->
  @message "access resource", "Payee server (merchant)", ->
    @reply "402 Payment Required", "Payer client (customer)"
@found "Payer client (customer)", ->
  @message "GET payment request", "Payee server (merchant)", ->
    @reply "payment request", "Payer client (customer)"
@found "Payer client (customer)", ->
  @message "POST payment request", "Payment Service Provider (customer)", ->
    @reply "payment response", "Payer client (customer)"
@found "Payer client (customer)", ->
  @message "POST payment response", "Payee server (merchant)", ->
    @message "verification", ->
      @reply "grant access to resource", "Payer client (customer)"
  </script>

  <p class="issue">
It may be a good idea to return the payment request with the 402 response.
The concern is that this would be a misrepresentation of the resource. The
counter-argument is that a client shouldn't interpret a 402 response as
the resource, and since 402 has not been formally defined yet, we could
define it to always come with a payment request response.
  </p>

  <ol class="algorithm">
    <li>
The <a>payee</a>'s web page requests payment by responding with a 402 Payment Required
response code and a URL encoded in the <code>Location</code> header
to fetch the <code>request</code> from.
    </li>
    <li>
The <a>payment mediator</a> fetches the <code>request</code> from the URL specified
in the <code>Location</code> header in the previous step.
    </li>
    <li>
The <a>payment mediator</a> scans the list of previously registered <a>payment app</a>s
and finds matches against <code>acceptedMethods</code> in the
payment request.
    </li>
    <li>
A <a>payment app</a> is selected by the <a>payment mediator</a> or the <a>payer</a>. The
process MAY consist of one or more of the following steps:

      <div class="issue">
This payment app selection process should probably be moved out into a separate
<a>payment mediator</a> specification and referenced from this specification.
      </div>

      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
If there is only one app that matches, that is automatically set
to the <em>selected <a>payment app</a></em>.
        </li>
        <li>
If there is a pre-existing preference set by the <a>payer</a> that narrows the
selection of the <a>payment app</a> to one match, the match is set to the
<em>selected <a>payment app</a></em>.
        </li>
        <li>
If there is more than one potential match, the <a>payer</a> is asked which
app they would like to use and the selection is set to the
<em>selected <a>payment app</a></em>
        </li>
        <li>
If there are no matches, the <a>payer</a> is notified and may be taken to an
alternate flow where a matching <a>payment app</a> is acquired.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
If the <a>payment app</a> does not require the payment flow to switch
to a 3rd party payment processor (e.g. cryptocurrency),
then the payment response is generated locally and the
payee's software is notified.

<div class="issue">
Steps 5, 6, and 7 are intended to provide for various flows envisioned by
the Web Payments ecosystem. This algorithm is merely a starting point,
is very much a work in progress, and is not asserted to be correct
at present:

<ol style="border-left: 0px;" class="clear-algorithm">
  <li>
Let "selectedApp" be the payment app selected by the payment mediator.
  </li>
  <li>
Let "selectedMethod" be the payment method provided by the
payee and selected by the payer.
  </li>
  <li>
If selectedMethod.paymentRequestService exists, re-direct the user
there (payee-based PSP).
  </li>
  <li>
If selectedApp.paymentRequestService exists, re-direct the user
there (payer-based PSP).
  </li>
  <li>
Otherwise, the payment response can be generated locally
(local PSP - Bitcoin and others).
  </li>
</ol>

</div>
    </li>
    <li>
If the app requires the payment flow to switch to a 3rd party
payer payment processor (e.g. push-payment like a PayPal/Google
Wallet-like app, ACH, ISO20022 style app):
      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
The <a>payment mediator</a> forwards the <code>request</code>, via
an HTTP POST to the
<code>paymentRequestService</code> in the <a>payment app</a> for approval.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
If the app requires the payment flow to switch to a 3rd party
payee payment processor (e.g. pull-payment like non-EMV magstripe credit
card with embossed PAN and CVV2, or tokenized credit card):
      <ol class="algorithm">
        <li>
The <a>payment mediator</a> forwards the request on via an HTTP POST
to the <code>paymentRequestService</code> in the
<code>acceptedMethod</code> (note that the <a>payee</a>
sets this, not the <a>payment app</a>).
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
The payment flow is then transferred to the entity that is going to
generate the <em>payment acknowledgment</em> (locally installed
payment app, <a>payee</a>'s payment service provider, or <a>payer</a>'s
payment service provider).
    </li>
    <li>
Once the entity in control of the payment flow finalizes the
<em>payment response</em>, even if the message is to
acknowledge that the payment failed, the <em>payment response</em>
is generated and the <a>payer</a>'s <a>payment mediator</a> is notified via an HTTP 200
success code.

<div class="issue">
Returning an HTTP status code of 200 when a payment fails is controversial.

The current thinking seems to be that 200 is the right thing to do as
the message was processed successfully (that's what the 200 is referring to).
The result of processing the message, however, has nuance that may be
dependent on the payment method used.

As a thought experiment, what should the HTTP response code be in the
following cases:

<ol style="border-left: 0px;" class="clear-algorithm">
  <li>
Funds transfer was initiated and completed. Clearly 200, right?
  </li>
  <li>
Funds transfer was initiated, but network delay may cause it to fail at a
later point in time (ACH, etc.). 102 or 202?
  </li>
  <li>
Request for subscription was noted and is setup, but no funds were moved. 200?
  </li>
  <li>
Payment submitted to network, but network didn't respond with an auth code. 504?
  </li>
  <li>
Cryptocurrency payment was submitted to network but a fork has been detected
and it is unclear if we're on the winning or losing fork. 102 or 202?
  </li>

</ol>

There are not enough HTTP status codes to try and enumerate the nuanced
potential outcomes so the best we can do at present (it seems) is to just report
on whether or not the payment request was processed successfully or not and
let the payee determine if the outcome of the transaction was valid from their
viewpoint. In many nuanced cases, it's up to the payer to decide if it was
"successful" or not (like waiting on a certain number of acknowledgments
from a blockchain, for example).
</div>
  </ol>
  <p class="issue">
Melvin Carvalho has also raised an issue noting that we may not want to use
402 and the Location header, but rather an additional HTTP header called
<code>Payment</code> that is compatible with multiple 4xx error conditions.

    <h3>Payment app Registration</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
The <a>payer</a>'s HTTP client navigates to a payment service provider website
and authenticates itself to fetch a <a>payment app</a> to register:
        <pre class="example" title="Authenticated GET of <a>payment app</a>">
GET /apps/visa HTTP/1.1
Host: mybank.example.org
Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2017 20:51:35 GMT
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Digest username="jdoe", realm="jane@mybank.example.org", ...
        </pre>
        <div class="issue">
While digest authentication is used above, more advanced authentication
schemes may also be employed. For example, the mechanism below uses
HTTP Signatures and public/private key cryptography to authenticate the client
with the server:
        <pre class="example" title="Authenticated GET of <a>payment app</a> using HTTP Signatures">
GET /apps/visa HTTP/1.1
Host: mybank.example.org
Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2017 20:51:35 GMT
Accept: application/json
Authorization: Signature keyId="https://mybank.example.org/people/jane/keys/42",
   algorithm="rsa-sha256",headers="(request-target) host date",

        </pre>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
The payment service provider MUST respond with the <a>payment app</a> or
an HTTP error code. If successful, something like the following will be
returned:
        <pre class="example" title="Successful retrieval of <a>payment app</a>">

    <h3>Initiating a Payment Request</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
The <a>payer</a>'s HTTP client accesses a resource that requires payment:
        <pre class="example" title="Payer requests a resource that requires a payment">
GET /movies/dr-strangelove HTTP/1.1
Host: videos.example.com
Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2017 21:31:35 GMT
        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
The <a>payee</a>'s HTTP server responds with a 402 Payment Required response
and the URL where the payment request may be fetched via the
<code>Location</code> header:
        <pre class="example" title="Payee responds with 402 Payment Required">
HTTP/1.1 402 Payment Required
Date: Tue, 07 Jun 2017 21:31:36 GMT
Location: https://videos.example.com/payment-requests/dr-strangelove
        </pre>

<div class="issue">
It's currently not clear if having an extra round-trip (steps 2 and 3) is
beneficial. The alternative is to respond with an HTTP 402 and the payment
request (step 4)  when the GET for the initial resource is performed. This
removes the need to do an extra GET at the expense of providing a little
more flexibility wrt. the location of the payment request service. For example,
having the Location header enables software developers to split media servers
from payment processing servers. That said, there are techniques to do this
today without the extra layer of indirection.
</div>
      </li>
      <li>

    <h3>Generating a Payment Response</h3>
    <ol>

A <a>payment app</a> is selected by the <a>payment mediator</a>
to process the payment request generated in the previous section.
      </li>
      <li>
The <code>paymentRequestService</code> URL, provided in the <a>payment app</a>
or the payment request, is used as the HTTP POST endpoint. The payment service
provider that is providing the <a>payment app</a> interface receives the
payment request, authenticates the <a>payer</a>, and proceeds with the payment:
      <pre class="example" title="The payment request is POSTed by the payment mediator for processing at the payment app">
POST /services/cards/2745023475 HTTP/1.1

        </pre>
      </li>
      <li>
The payment service provider generates a payment response message that
contains enough information to verify that the transaction has completed in
success or failure:
        <pre class="example" title="The payment response is provided back to the payment mediator from the payment app">
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

    <h2>Message Extensibility</h2>

    <p class="issue">
One proposal for providing message extensibility is to allow messages to
be interpreted as JSON-LD with a specific context, such as
<code>https://example.org/contexts/web-payments/v1</code>. Doing this would
not only solve message versioning, but it would also enable
decentralized extensibility for all payment messages while ensuring that
there are no clashes in terminology between industry verticals.
