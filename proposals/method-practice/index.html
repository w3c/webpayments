      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The Payment Request API [[!PAYMENTREQUESTAPI]] provides a
      standard way to initiate payment requests from Web pages and
      applications. The Web Payments Working Group is designing the
      API so that it may be used with a broad variety of payment
      methods, including card payments, direct debits and credits,
      proprietary payment methods, and distributed ledgers.  The
      purpose of this document is to assist those who wish to describe
      how to use a given payment method with
	[[!PAYMENTREQUESTAPI]].</p>

      <p class="note">This is an early draft and we recognize that we need more experience with payment method specifications to strengthen the document.</p>

    <section id="artifacts">
      <h2>Payment Method Artifacts</h2>
      <p>A payment method is a system and set of rules for payments. A number of "artifacts" make it possible use a payment method with the PaymentRequest API:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>A "payment method specification," which is a description of the request and response data exchanged between the browser and payment apps when the payment method is invoked.</li>
	<li>A machine-readable manifest (available when dereferencing the payment method identifier) with instructions about using the payment method in practice (e.g., with information about payment apps that support the payment method). <strong>Note:</strong> The Web Payments Working Group expects to specify a vocabulary for this manifest file; see the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webpayments/proposals//Payment-Manifest-Proposal.html">draft Payment Method Manifest specification</a>.</li>
	<li>An payment method identifier that serves two purposes: it is used in the matching algorithm of [[!PAYMENTREQUESTAPI]] and can be dereferenced for the manifest. For syntax and other information about payment method identifiers, see [[!METHODIDENTIFIERS]].</li>
      </ul>

      <section>
	<h3 id="structure">Structure of a Payment Method Specification</h3>
	<p>A payment method specification SHOULD include:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>A payment method identifier.</li>
	  <li>Information that parties must provide as input to the payment request API that is specific to the payment method (and not general information about the transaction). This is done via the <code>data</code> parameter of the <code>PaymentRequest</code> constructor.</li>
	  <li>Information that will be in the response from the payment request API. This will typically be information collected from the user (e.g., card number for card payments) through user interface displayed by the browser.</li>
	  <li>Any other payment method-specific requirements that are not addressed by the underlying payment request API, and that developers of payment apps need to take into account when building support for the payment method. See the next section for some payment method specific considerations.</li>
 <li>Recommended behavior to handle exceptions (e.g., in case of network failures)</li>

    <section id="specifics">
      <h2>Payment Method Specific Considerations</h2>

      <section>
	<h3 id="ux">User Experience</h3>
	<p>For some payment methods that require a variety of
	  data from the user (that will figure in the payment
	  response), some of that data may not be required for
	  all transactions. To enable payment apps to provide
	  a streamlined user experience, authors of payment method specifications may wish to address topics such as:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Allowing the payee to specify which data is required to be able to process the transaction. This information allows the payment app to only request required information from the user, decreasing the risk of abandonment.</li>
	</ul>
      </section>


      <section>
	<h3 id="security">Security and Privacy</h3>
	<p>It is important to protect user data and ensure that
	  it is exchanged securely throughout the network.</p>
	<p>Authors of payment method specifications may wish to address topics such as:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>tokenization of information in the payment response</li>
	  <li>topics that may vary by regulatory regime, such as whether
	    data may be stored by a payment app.</li>
	  <li>links for developers to relevant rules defined for the payment method</li>
	</ul>
      </section>

      <section>
	<h3 id="network">Failures and Reconciliation</h3>
	<p>Some payment methods may be more sensitive to various failures
	  (e.g., network) than others. To help parties with reconciliation of
	  information after failures, each transaction can be identified with a unique paymentRequestID. <strong>Note:</strong> This is still under discussion; see <a href="https://github.com/w3c/browser-payment-api/issues/224">issue 224</a>) and  <a href="https://github.com/w3c/browser-payment-api/issues/287">issue 287</a>.</p>
	<p>Payment methods may define additional mechanisms to make use of the paymentRequestID. For example:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>The payment method may enable payees to provide a URL (in the Payment Request data) so that payment services can send transaction status information asynchronously to the payee. The status information that is useful to communicate (e.g., success, fail, processing, etc.) will depend on the payment method.</li>
	  <li>Parties may secure the callback channel in a variety of
ways. Some parties may wish to provide the same data asynchronously
	    that is available synchronously through Payment Request API. To do this
	    securely is likely to involve some form of mutual authentication. Establishing mutual authentication may involve a burden (e.g., key or certificate exchange) that some parties do not wish to bear. Therefore, some
payment servers may prefer to send minimal information to the
payee, and require the payee to query the payment server for
	    authoritative status information.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Reconciliation patterns may differ if software exchanging information is owned by the same entity, such as when an organization manages an E-Commerce site and also distributes the payment app the user has selected to pay.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
	<h3 id="versionin">Versioning</h3>
	<p>We anticipate that payment methods will change over time. The Working Group anticipates that the ecosystem will use different payment method identifiers to distinguish versions. A merchant that accepts multiple versions of a payment method can supply multiple identifiers.</p>
      </section>

      
    </section>

    <section id="operations">
      <h2>Operational Considerations</h2>
      <section id="operations">
	<h2>Payment Method Manifest Files</h2>
	<ul>
	  <li>Addressing. Update this based on the outcome of <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-method-identifiers/issues/19">issue 19</a>.</li>
	  <li>Performance. Web site managers should set up mechanisms such as caching to ensure that payment manifest files are served efficiently, as they may be frequently fetched. <strong>Note:</strong> Need to add some guidance here.</li>
	</ul>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section id="publishing">
      <h2>W3C Publishing Policy</h2>
      <p>W3C does <strong>not</strong> intend to define any payment
	methods. However, W3C does plan to publish a small number of payment method
	specifications (such as [[!CARDPAYMENT]]) that capture common
	practice of existing payment methods. This is to:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>bootstrap the payment request API ecosystem</li>
	<li>ensure that the design of payment request API will work in practice with a variety of payment flows</li>
	<li>provide an example of how to write a payment method specification</li>
      </ul>

      <p>W3C only anticipates publishing payment method specifications
	as formal technical reports for open payment methods. <strong>Note:</strong> The Working Group is still developing a definition for "open payment method" but a key aspect is that anybody can write a (third party) payment app that implements the payment method, without a prior business agreement.</p>


      <p><strong>Note</strong>: It may be that the Web Payments Working Group identifies payment method patterns across a set of proprietary payment methods, in which case, the group may wish to publish a generic "open" payment method specification analogous to the way that [[!CARDPAYMENT]] abstracts data requirements from different card networks.</p>
