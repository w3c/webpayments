      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>The Payment Request API [[!PAYMENTREQUESTAPI]] provides a
      standard way to initiate payment requests from Web pages and
      applications. The Web Payments Working Group is designing the
      API so that it may be used with a broad variety of payment
      methods, including card payments, direct debits and credits,
      proprietary payment methods, and distributed ledgers.  The
      purpose of this document is to assist those who wish to describe
      how to use a given payment method with
	[[!PAYMENTREQUESTAPI]].</p>

      <p class="note">This is an early draft and we recognize that we need more experience with payment method specifications to strengthen the document.</p>

    <section id="artifacts">
      <h2>Payment Method Artifacts</h2>
      <p>A payment method is a system and set of rules for payments. A number of "artifacts" make it possible use a payment method with the PaymentRequest API:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>A "payment method specification," which is a description of the request and response data exchanged between the browser and payment apps when the payment method is invoked.</li>
	<li>A machine-readable manifest (available when dereferencing the payment method identifier) with instructions about using the payment method in practice (e.g., with information about payment apps that support the payment method). <strong>Note:</strong> The Web Payments Working Group expects to specify a vocabulary for this manifest file; see the <a href="https://github.com/zkoch/zkoch.github.io/blob/master/payment-manifest.md">proposal under consideration</a>.</li>
	<li>An payment method identifier that serves two purposes: it is used in the matching algorithm of [[!PAYMENTREQUESTAPI]] and can be dereferenced for the manifest. For syntax and other information about payment method identifiers, see [[!METHODIDENTIFIERS]].</li>
      </ul>

      <section>
	<h3 id="structure">Structure of a Payment Method Specification</h3>
	<p>A payment method specification SHOULD include:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>A payment method identifier.</li>
	  <li>Information that parties must provide as input to the payment request API that is specific to the payment method (and not general information about the transaction). This is done via the <code>data</code> parameter of the <code>PaymentRequest</code> constructor.</li>
	  <li>Information that will be in the response from the payment request API. This will typically be information collected from the user (e.g., card number for card payments) through user interface displayed by the browser.</li>
	  <li>Any other payment method-specific requirements that are not addressed by the underlying payment request API, and that developers of payment apps need to take into account when building support for the payment method. See the next section for some payment method specific considerations.</li>
 <li>Recommended behavior to handle exceptions (e.g., in case of network failures)</li>

    <section id="specifics">
      <h2>Payment Method Specific Considerations</h2>

      <section>
	<h3 id="ux">User Experience</h3>
	<p>For some payment methods that require a variety of
	  data from the user (that will figure in the payment
	  response), some of that data may not be required for
	  all transactions. To enable payment apps to provide
	  a streamlined user experience, authors of payment method specifications may wish to address topics such as:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Allowing the payee to specify which data is required to be able to process the transaction. This information allows the payment app to only request required information from the user, decreasing the risk of abandonment.</li>
	</ul>
      </section>


      <section>
	<h3 id="security">Security and Privacy</h3>
	<p>It is important to protect user data and ensure that
	  it is exchanged securely throughout the network.</p>
	<p>Authors of payment method specifications may wish to address topics such as:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>tokenization of information in the payment response</li>
	  <li>topics that may vary by regulatory regime, such as whether
	    data may be stored by a payment app.</li>
	  <li>links for developers to relevant rules defined for the payment method</li>
	</ul>
      </section>

      <section>
	<h3 id="network">Network Failures</h3>
	<p>Some payment methods may be more sensitive to network failures
	  than others (e.g., push payments may be more sensitive than
	  pull payments such as card payments).
	<p>Authors of payment method specifications may wish to address topics such as:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Asynchronous notifications to the payee about the status of processing a payment. Thus, the payment request API can provide one response to the payee ("through the front end") and the payment app or payment processor can provide a redundant response directly to a payee server ("through the backend"). This may be implemented in a variety of ways. For example:
	    <ul>
	      <li>If a payment app is associated with the origin of the payee, the payment app may encode how back end communication will take place.</li>
	      <li>If a payment app is not associated with the origin of the payee, the payee may provide a callback URL via the payment request API that the payment app may use to contact the payee. Or, the payment app can pass that data along to a payment server for that purpose.</li>
	    </ul>
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </section>
    </section>


      <section id="publishing">
      <h2>W3C Publishing Policy</h2>
      <p>W3C does <strong>not</strong> intend to define any payment
	methods. However, W3C does plan to publish a small number of payment method
	specifications (such as [[!CARDPAYMENT]]) that capture common
	practice of existing payment methods. This is to:</p>

      <ul>
	<li>bootstrap the payment request API ecosystem</li>
	<li>ensure that the design of payment request API will work in practice with a variety of payment flows</li>
	<li>provide an example of how to write a payment method specification</li>
      </ul>

      <p>W3C only anticipates publishing payment method specifications
	as formal technical reports for open payment methods. <strong>Note:</strong> The Working Group is still developing a definition for "open payment method" but a key aspect is that anybody can write a (third party) payment app that implements the payment method, without a prior business agreement.</p>


      <p><strong>Note</strong>: It may be that the Web Payments Working Group identifies payment method patterns across a set of proprietary payment methods, in which case, the group may wish to publish a generic "open" payment method specification analogous to the way that [[!CARDPAYMENT]] abstracts data requirements from different card networks.</p>
