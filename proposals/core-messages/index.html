  <p>
This document specifies the core Web Payments messages that are used to
initiate and acknowledge a payment request. The messages are typically passed
between the software ecosystem that inititates, executes, and finalizes
Web Payments.
  </p>

<section id="sotd">

  <p>The most effective way to report issues and request features is to
  engage the working group via the Github
  <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments/issues">issue tracker</a>
  for the Working Group. Submitting issues as well as pull requests for
  changes to the specification are encouraged.</p>

  <h1>Introduction</h1>

  <p>
When requesting and fulfilling a payment on the Web, a number of messages
need to be passed between various parties to execute the movement of funds.
This specification details those core messages and provides instructions on
how to interpret those messages in a variety of operating environments.
  </p>

  <section class="informative">
    <h2>How to Read this Document</h2>

    <p>This document is detailed specification for a set of core messages
    related to initiating, executing, and finalizing payments on the Web.
    The document is primarily intended for the following audiences:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Software developers who want to understand the design decisions and
        structure of the core messages.</li>
      <li>Software developers who want to implement Web Payments systems.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="normative">
    <h3>Terminology</h3>

  <p class="issue">
The terminology in this specification's terminology and messages need to be
updated to match the
<a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments/wiki/A-Payments-Initiation-Architecture-for-the-Web">Payments Architecture document</a>.

  <h2>The Data Model</h2>

  <p class="issue">
The data model used for the messages in this specification is intended to be
easily readable and understood by non-technologists. Therefore, it is neither
rigorous nor formal. Some of the more classicly trained software designers
may find this disconcerting as types and ranges are not strictly locked down
at the data model layer. Others will find the need for an abstract data model
unnecessary, preferring to express the messages in a more concrete syntax.
Some may want to use UML, others may want RDF, and others may prefer JSON's
data model. In short, the way the data model is used and expressed in this
document is up for discussion. The only requirement is that we use something
that is easily understood by most readers and that's flexible enough to work
with a variety of programming environments while empowering developers to
use validation tooling (like JSON Schema) if the facility is available to them.
  </p>

  <p>
When designing software systems, the data model used to express
the components of the system is important. Data models tend to vary in their
formalism. Some data models are more abstract where data values are not typed
and only vaguely defined as to what their allowable values may be.
Other data models are more concrete, with strongly defined value types and
ranges.
  </p>

  <p>
The data model used to document the messages in this specification tends
toward being more abstract. This is done to aid readability and ensure that
the data model can be applied in a variety of programming environments. There
is also a mechanism that we use in this specification that enables more
formalism when it comes to data types and ranges. This is done to ensure that
programmers can re-use specific data validation tooling if it is available to
them.
  </p>

  <p>
In an attempt to make the description of this approach easier to understand,
note the following simple example of a <code>HelloWorld</code>
message definition:
  </p>

<h5 style="font-size: 1.2em">HelloWorld</h5>

  <p>
A message that is used to greet the world.
  </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><code>title</code></dt>
        <dd>
A short human-readable title for the message.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>message</code></dt>
        <dd>
The message text itself.
        </dd>
      </dl>

  <p>
Note that there are no formal data value constraints expressed in the message
definition in the data model. Even though the data model is fairly abstract,
constraints can still be placed on the values in each concrete syntax (e.g.
JSON Schema in most JSON environments). These constraints can be found in the
sections titled
<a href="#expressing-messages-as-webidl">Expressing Messages as WebIDL</a>,
<a href="#expressing-messages-as-json">Expressing Messages as JSON</a>, and
<a href="#expressing-messages-as-json-ld">Expressing Messages as JSON-LD</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
For example, if a developer wanted to express the <code>HelloWorld</code>
message definition above in JSON, the following JSON Schema could be used to
validate such a message:
  </p>

  <pre class="highlight">
{
  "title": "HelloWorld Message JSON Schema",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "title": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "message": {
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "required": ["title", "message"]
}
  </pre>

  <h2>Core Message Components</h2>

    <section>
      <h3><dfn>FinancialAmount</dfn></h3>
      <p>
A <a><code>FinancialAmount</code></a> is used to express a scalar financial
value.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><code><dfn>currency</dfn></code></dt>
        <dd>
<code>currency</code> is a string containing a three-character alphaneumeric
code for the currency as defined by [[!ISO4217]] or a URL for a currency
identifier. For example, <code>"USD"</code> for US Dollars or
<code>"https://example.com/currencies/experimental-XYZ"</code> for a new
experimental currency.
        </dd>
        <dt><code><dfn>amount</dfn></code></dt>
        <dd>
A string containing the decimal monetary value. The string MUST use a single
U+002E FULL STOP character as the decimal separator. The string MUST begin
with a single U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS character if the value is negative. All
other characters must be characters in the range U+0030 DIGIT ZERO (0) to
U+0039 DIGIT NINE (9).
<div class="note">
The string should match the regular expression
<code>^-?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$</code>.
</div>
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <p>The following example shows how to represent $55.00 US Dollars.</p>
      <pre class="example highlight" title="$55 US Dollars expressed as JSON">
{
  "amount": "55.00",
  "currency": "USD"
}
      </pre>
    </section>

an associated payment method specification). For example,
<code>"VisaLegacy"</code> or
<code>"https://newnetwork.example.com/methods/SuperCard"</code>

        </dd>
        <dt><code>paymentAmount</code></dt>
        <dd>
The <a>FinancialAmount</a> requested by the <a>payee</a>. The value may also be
a set of <a>FinancialAmount</a>s that express the desired amount in
different currencies.
        </dd>
      </dl>

      <pre class="example highlight"
        title="Payment for $4.35 USD may be fulfilled using non-tokenized Visa and Mastercard expressed as JSON">
{
  "paymentMethod": ["VisaLegacy", "MasterCardLegacy"],
  "paymentAmount": {
    "amount": "4.35",
    "currency": "USD"
}
      </pre>

<section>
  <h2>Core Messages</h2>

    <section>
      <h3><dfn>PaymentRequest</dfn></h3>

      <p>
A <a><code>PaymentRequest</code></a> expresses a payment that is requested
by a <a>payee</a>.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><code>type</code></dt>
        <dd>
A set of one or more type identifiers associated with the object, typically
set to <code>"PaymentRequest"</code>.

<div class="issue">The set of available types MAY be extended
in the future to, for example, add things like
<code>"SubscriptionRequest"</code> to identify payment requests that may
have some recurring quality to them.
</div>
        </dd>
        <dt><code>description</code></dt>
        <dd>
A human-readable description of the reason the payment request was initiated.
This text MAY be displayed to the <a>payer</a> in a payment interface.
For example, <code>"Payment for widgets from Acme Anvil Emporium"</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>acceptablePayment</code></dt>
        <dd>
One or more <a>AcceptablePaymentMethod</a>s that the <a>payee</a> will
accept as payment.
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <pre class="example highlight"

        <dt><code>type</code></dt>
        <dd>
An type identifier associated with the object, typically set to
<code>"PaymentResponse"</code>.

<div class="issue">
The set of available types MAY be extended in the future to add things
like <code>Receipt</code> to identify acknowledgements that contain
receipt information.
</div>
        </dd>
        <dt><code>description</code></dt>
        <dd>
Human readable text that will be used to identify what the payment was for.
This text MAY be displayed to the <a>payer</a>. For example,
<code>"Payment to ExampleMerch for widgets"</code>.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>payment</code></dt>
        <dd>
Information such as the payment method used and the payment amount. Payment
method specific information, such as the status of the payment, may also be
included. The presence and meaning of this extra information is dependent on
the payment method. The payment information may be used by the <a>payee</a> or
their associated <a>payment service provider</a> to, for example, finalize a
payment or display information to the <a>payer</a>.
        </dd>

    <h2>Expressing Messages as JSON</h2>

    <p>
The Web Payments messages described in this specification are intended to be
used in programming environments that support JSON. The conformance language
for JSON objects is JSON Schema. The table below cross-references the messages
in this specification to their JSON Schema definitions.
    </p>

  <section>
    <h2>Expressing Messages as JSON-LD</h2>

    <p class="issue">
One proposal for providing message extensibility is to allow messages to
be interpreted as JSON-LD with a specific context, such as
<code>https://example.org/contexts/web-payments/v1</code>. Doing this would
not only solve message versioning, but it would also enable
decentralized extensibility for all payment messages while ensuring that
there are no clashes in terminology between industry verticals.
    </p>

    <p>
The Web Payments messages described in this specification are intended to be
used in programming environments that support JSON-LD. The conformance language
for JSON-LD objects is a JSON-LD Frame coupled with JSON Schema. The table
below cross-references the messages in this specification to their
JSON-LD Frames and JSON Schema definitions.
    </p>


    <table class="simple">
