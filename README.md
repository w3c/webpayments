# webpayments

The document repository for the W3C Web Payments Working Group.

# Introduction

For a newcomer to the group, Github can feel somewhat overwhelming. We maintain more information and explanation in our wiki https://github.com/w3c/webpayments/wiki  

If you want to look at specific documents, each is contained in a separate repository so that we can manage specific issues against those specifications.  

# How does this all fit together?

The proposed overall architecture is laid out in a number of wiki articles beginning with some [explanatory text](https://github.com/w3c/webpayments/wiki/A-Payments-Initiation-Architecture-for-the-Web)  

There is also a helpful ["explainer" text](https://w3c.github.io/webpayments/proposals/wparch/) which is still a proposal at time of writing - nevertheless, new participants might find it instructive.

You may find it useful to know that Github by default presents files in their "raw" form, including HTML documents. You can see any HTML document in a browser by adding 

    http://htmlpreview.github.io/?  

to the beginning of the URL of that document. This is particular helpful for looking at documents which are still draft.

This WG is currently working on the following specifications which are all in their own repositories, which are listed below:

## Specifications

* Payment Method Identifiers - https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-method-identifiers
* Payment Request API - https://github.com/w3c/browser-payment-api/
* HTTP API - https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-http-api
* Payments Core Messages - https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-core-messages

## Payment Method Specifications

* Card - https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-methods-card
* Credit Transfer and Direct Debit - https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-methods-credit-transfer-direct-debit

## Proposed Specifications

These are incubated in the proposals folder of this repo until being abandoned or adopted as editor's drafts by the WG.

* Payment Apps - https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-payment-apps-api
* Alipay Payment Method - https://w3c.github.io/webpayments/proposals/Alipay-payment-method.html
